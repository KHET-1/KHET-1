# Hey, I'm Khet 👋

Veteran game dev turned indie tool builder. Shipped on 173+ titles at places like Bungie, Bethesda, and Twitter (back in the day). Now crafting bite-sized dev tools that fix real pains—like terminal encoding nightmares.

💎 Currently polishing **diterm**: The diamond-forger for mojibake garbage.

### AAA Highlights (via [MobyGames](https://www.mobygames.com/(redacted))
- Destiny 2
- Saints Row: The Third
- Darksiders II
- ...and a ton more blockbuster chaos

### What I'm Building Now
- [diterm](https://github.com/khet-1/diterm) – Auto-fix terminal encoding with 95% magic
- Other experiments in dev productivity & AI tinkering
- 50+ private projects I'm going to release slowly

### Tech Stack Vibes
Python • CLI tools • Game engines (Unity/Unreal vets) • Whatever ships fast
